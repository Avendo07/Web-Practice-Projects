        Classification of any news item /post / blog into fake or   real   one   has   generated   great   interest   from researchers around the globe. Severalresearch studies have  been  carried out tofind effectof  falsifiedand fabricated newson  masses  and  reactions  of  people upon coming through such newsitems. Falsifiednews or  fabricatedposnewst  is  any textual  or  non-textual content that is fakeandis generated so the readers will start  believing  in  something  which  is  not  true.For Example  recently  a  news  item  was  floated  on  social media  networking platform Facebook by a accredited Journalist of Srinagar J&K Titled “ Beasts in White Aprons ” regarding mismanagement and carelessness of  doctors  in  a  local  Pediatric  hospital  of  Srinagar with  a  Image  (  (refer toleft  part  in  Figure  1  Original but misinterpreted) .<br>
        <br>
        The  following  are  the  psychological  factors  which convince  a  readers  to  believe  in  any  falsified  post  or news item: Author:Authorof postmakes a compelling statement about   negligence   and   careless   of   doctors   in   the hospital. Generally nobody will do a fact checking on such   news   when   it   is   posted   by   an   accredited journalist and is supported by the a valid image.Image:   The  impact  of  a  falseor  fabricated  news  is increased many fold when it is supported by an image. In this  post the  image supportswhat  post  is alarming about. Image depictsthe burned leg of an infant. Source/Author : The author plays a vital role about the credibility of the news/post.  Platform   :   Since   the   userbase   of   the   platform   , Facebook  in  this  case  ,  is  very  huge  and  diversified which results in its exponential growth. Although there are multiple  news carrier platforms which include SNS , stand alone websites , blogs and microblogs  emails etc. But this paper will emphasize on  Social  Media  networking  sites  (  Facebook  and Twitter).

        The  results  show  15  percent  fake  tweets,  45  %  real tweets , rest posts where undecided.The Authors of [4] in their paper suggested deception detection using  labelled benchmark data set ‘ LIAR ’ with evident  improved efficiency  in detection of  fake posts/news. The Authors arguedthe use of corpus for classification    of stance ,opinion mining,    rumor  detection, and political NLP research.  The    authors  of  [7]  have  Introduced  Need  for  hoax detection  .  They  Used  ML  approach  by  combining  news   content   and   social   content   approaches.  The authors  Claim  the  performance  is  good  as  compared to described  in  literature. The authors Implemented  it with  Facebook  messenger  chatbot.  Three  different datasets  of  Italian  news  posts  of  Facebookwhere used.  Both  content  based  methods    with  social  and content   signals   using   Boolean      crowd   sourcing algorithms   where   implemented   .   The   following Methods where used by the : 1.Content based 2.Logistic regression on social signals. 3.Harmonic   Boolean   label   crowdsourcing   on social signals.The  authors  in  [9] observed about    14  million messages retweeted  about400  thousand  times  on Twitter    during    and    following    the    2016    U.S. Presidential  campaign  and  election  by  bots.   The methods to categorizethe posts spread by  bots where described.The Authors in [10] have described  Tabloidization in the  form  of  Click  baiting.  They  have  described  Click baiting    as  a  form  of    rapid  dissemination  of    rumor and   misinformation   online   .   The   authors   have discussed potential methods for automatic detection of clickbait as a form of deception.   Content cues which includes  lexical  and  semantic  level  of  analysis  where implemented by the authors. The  authors  in  [13] observedthe  principles,  methodsand   algorithms employed for classification   offalsified  and  fabricated news items, authorsand subjects  from  online  social  networks  and  evaluating the corresponding  reach and performance. The paper also suggested the research challenges throughthe undiscovered characteristics of fake news and diverse connections    among    news    articles, authorsand subjects. The Authors of the paperdiscussautomatic fake  news inference  model  named  as FakeDetectorIt is  based  on  textual  classification    and builds  a  deep diffusive  network  model  to  learn  the  representations of news articles, authorsand subjects simultaneously<br>

        FakeDetector addressestwo   main   components: representation  feature  learning,  and  credibility  label inference,   which   together   will   compose  the   deep diffusive network model FakeDetector
